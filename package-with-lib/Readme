Building, installing and using a simple package consisting in a single library (named `dummy`)

To build and test the library (w/o installing the package)
- cd build/src
- dune build dummy.cma
- cd ../test
- dune build test.exe
- dune exec ./test.exe

To test the library from the toplevel
- open test/use_ml  (note: this file deliberately _not_ named use.ml)
- evaluate phrases (note: first force Caml mode by invoking M-x tuareg-mode)

To build the package
- cd ./build
- make 
- make test
- make install
- make opam.install 
- make opam.show (checks that a package with name "dummy" is not already installed) 

To use the package
- cd ../use
- make doc.view
- make 

To uninstall the package
- cd ../build
- make opam.remove
